<h2>Mentee Testimonials</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I'm so grateful to have Maitreyee as my mentor :)
I'm very thankful for inviting me to some of the group events so that I got to know more people from the SPIRAL team and the Clancy lab (and Palash!). Having a chance to talk to them is a valuable experience for an undergraduate like me.
Also, thank you Maitreyee for helping me with my CV and finding summer internship! You don't know how much that's a relief for me to have someone with experience and knows me well to guide me through this process. And thank you for all your suggestions on helping me build a stronger resume. It really benefits me as I know which parts I shall be working on more.
My favorite part is that I feel like my ideas and questions are always welcomed and respected. You always responses everything I proposed with patient, even some of them are bizarre ideas. I really appreciate the feedbacks I got, either positive of negative, as I feel like my ideas are being carefully considered. I really enjoy sharing with you the new things I learned in class, and discuss with you some of the connections I made to the project we're working on.</i>&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Maitreyee has a been great mentor. She has helped me analyze complex problems by breaking them down into their fundamental constituents. This has given me a new perspective on how to study complex systems and I apply this technique to other aspects in my life. She is a keen listener and never shys away from asking questions. I am also very impressed by her ability to manage time and effort on multiple projects.</i>&rdquo;
</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I liked the check-in meetings and examples and working through code together. It was very helpful and gave me a good introduction to doing research now. I also thought it was valuable to get a project complete throughout the program (poster). Lastly, I liked the help with grad school applications.</i>&rdquo;</p>
