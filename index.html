<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate with <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/paulette-clancy/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Paulette Clancy</a> and <a href="https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/hernandez-lab/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Rigoberto Hernandez</a> at Johns Hopkins University. 
I currently work on developing computational material discovery algorithms and multi-scale material models for energy and space applications. 
Before this, I completed my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, advised by <a href="https://chess.grainger.illinois.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Prof. Marco Panesi</a>.
My Ph.D. thesis focused on developing a computational framework to accurately predict and mitigate heating on spacecraft surfaces. 
My work has been recognized by multiple awards and honors, including Aerospace Engineering Alumni Advisory Board Fellowship (UIUC), Rising Stars in Aerospace (MIT), Mavis Future Faculty Fellowship (UIUC), Outstanding Asian & Asian American Graduate Student Leader Award (UIUC), Block Grant Fellowship (UIUC) and one of the nine UIUC finalists nominated for the Schmidt Science Fellows National Competition.
I am committed to enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM through mentoring, outreach, and service activities. 
</p>
<p>Apart from research, I love dancing and teaching dance (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40Mywao-zxY&amp;t=560s&amp;ab_channel=SPICMACAYIllinois" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>watch my students perform</a>). I have trained in Bharatnatyam, an Indian classical dance form, for over 20 years with Prof. M. R. Krishnamurthy. Head to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jhfrNRHa0w&amp;ab_channel=MaitreyeeSharma" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>YouTube channel</a> to watch excerpts from my performances. I also enjoy practicing yoga, playing tennis, hiking, swimming and playing the piano.
